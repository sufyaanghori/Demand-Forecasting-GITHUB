Olist is a prominent online e-commerce platform connecting merchants to the main marketplaces of Brazil. The dataset comprises 100,000 orders between 2016 and 2018, offering valuable information on various aspects of the customer journey, including order status, pricing, payment, and customer reviews.\n\nPresented by Olist, this dataset underscores the platform's success in streamlining e-commerce operations for merchants across Brazilian marketplaces. Olist facilitates seamless connections between merchants and consumers through innovative solutions, fostering a unified and efficient e-commerce ecosystem.\n\nThis analysis will delve deeper into understanding the customer journey, comparing seller orders and their delivery times, and analyzing payment methods and payment installment patterns across different regions. Lastly, it will conduct an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, and by using this technique marketers can tailor their marketing strategies accordingly. We can easily analyze the segmentation to reveal the loyal customers and the retention customers. By unlocking the power of Brazilian e-commerce through data-driven insights, marketers can reach important findings that can contribute to strategic decision-making and drive further growth in the e-commerce landscape.\n\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n* [Project Overview](#project-overview)\n* [Data Sources](#data-sources)\n* [Tools](#tools)\n* [Data Cleaning & Preparation](#data-cleaning-preparation)\n* [Exploratory Data Analysis](#exploratory-data-analysis)\n* [Data Analysis](#data-analysis)\n* [Results&Findings](#results/findings)\n* [Recommendations](#recommendations)\n* [Limitations](#limitations)\n* [References](#references)\n\n## Tools\n\n- Excel- Data Cleaning\n   - [Download here] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)\n- PostgreSQL- Data Analysis\n- Python- Data Visualisation\n## Data Cleaning/Preparation\n\nIn the initial data preparation phase, the following tasks were performed:\n1.

And we will employ a barplot() function to visualize the unavailable or cancelled orders by month on the x-axis. The frequency of orders will be depicted on the y-axis.\n\n``` Python\nunavailable_or_cancelled_orders = order_status_distribution[(order_status_distribution['order_status'] == 'unavailable') | (order_status_distribution['order_status'] == 'cancelled')]\nmonths = sorted(unavailable_or_cancelled_orders['approved_month'].unique())\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nplt.bar(unavailable_or_cancelled_orders['approved_month'], unavailable_or_cancelled_orders['count'], color='brown', linewidth=3)\nplt.xticks(months, rotation=0, fontsize=10)\nplt.title('Monthly Friction of Unavailable or Cancelled Orders')\nplt.xlabel('Approved Month')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Orders')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n![Q1](https://github.com/denizyennerr/Brazilian_E-commerce_Analysis/assets/160275199/9d0f34a3-f381-4061-993f-3105067674eb)\n\n\n\n\nWe will apply the same filter with orders where the order status is delivered.

As such as cleaning the data to make it suitable for visualization.\n\n``` Python\ndays_of_the_month_order_count= pd.read_csv(r\"C:...\\Desktop\\days_of_the_month_ordercount.csv\")\n\ndays_of_the_month_order_count_cleaned= days_of_the_month_order_count.dropna()\nprint(days_of_the_month_order_count_cleaned)\n```\n\n``` Python\nplt.figure(figsize=(15, 8))\nsns.lineplot(x='days_of_the_month', y='order_count', data=days_of_the_month_order_count_cleaned, ci=None, marker='o', markersize=8) \nplt.title('Order Count by Days of the Month')\nplt.xlabel('Days of the Month ')\nplt.ylabel('Number of Orders')\nplt.xticks(days_of_the_month_order_count_cleaned['days_of_the_month'])\nplt.show()\n```\nThe line chart below displays the distribution of order counts across different days of the month.

Further analysis could be conducted to identify any underlying trends or patterns driving these fluctuations in order counts on different days of the month.\n\n\nNext, we will delve deeper into

Horizonte, and other cities in descending order of order count.\n\n\nNext, with the following query, we will be able to identify sellers who have a track record of delivering orders quickly while maintaining satisfactory average review scores from customers.\n\n``` SQL\nWITH fastest_delivered_products AS (\n    SELECT \n        oi.seller_id,\n        (o.order_delivered_customer_date -

Order Count by Days of the Week:\n- The distribution of orders across different days of the week shows variations, with certain days having higher order volumes in comparison to others.\n- A separate analysis can explain the main factor influencing daily order volumes, including external sources such as promotional campaigns, customer behavior patterns, and holidays.\n\n2. Monthly Orders for Delivered Orders:\n- As can be depicted from the bar chart the distribution of monthly delivery orders is represented and provides insights into the volume of orders processed over time.\n- Peaks and troughs in order volumes may coincide with seasonal trends, as such marketing campaigns or other factors that determine the customer's behavior.\n\n3. Top 5 Fastest Delivery Sellers by Average Review Score:\n- The top five sellers did this research based on their average shipment times and reviews.\n- Amazon transactions are affected by sellers with shorter delivery times and have the advantage of higher review scores, more customer attraction and retention.\n\n\n4.  Category-Wise Distribution of Payment Installments:\n- The analysis shows the distribution of payment installments across different product categories.\n- Understanding payment preferences can help optimize payment processing systems and tailor promotional offers to match customer preferences.\n\n\n5. Top Regions with Highest Number of Installment Payments:\n- Businesses can view their marketing efforts by identifying regions with the highest number of installment payments, according to their customer's needs.\n\n\n6. Distribution of Other Orders in Single and Multiple Installments:\n- The analysis examines the difference in the distribution of payments between payment orders in a single payment and multiple installments across various product categories.\n- Insights from this analysis can inform inventory management and pricing strategies to accommodate different payment preferences.\n\n\n7. Customer Segmentation Analysis:\n- Through RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis customers are divided into distinct groups, depending on their transactional behavior.\n- Customer groups like \"Champion,\" \"Promising\" and \"New Customers\" offer valuable insights to marketing and sales departments for targeted marketing and customer relationship management strategies.\n\n\n8. Customer Segmentation Results:\n- The segmentation analysis segments the customers into different groups based on their RFM score and their behavioral patterns which help to get a better understanding of the most loyal customers are for the company along with the retention rate of the lost customers.\n- On every customer segment we process an individual marketing and retaining tactic that should aim at gaining customer engagement and profitability.\n\n\n- These findings provide valuable insights for decision-making across various aspects of e-commerce operations, ranging from marketing to service, logistics as well as product management. Further exploration and refinement of these insights can lead to ameliorated customer satisfaction, increased customer retention, and improved business success.\n\n\n### Limitations\n- The digital business market in Brazil is an incredibly vital and dynamic industry. The market is influenced by various factors such as regulatory changes, technological innovations,  and competitiveness. There may be some changes in the past that could not cover these dynamic shifts completely.\n- In this way, the dataset emphasizes the transactions inside the Olist platform instead of the market as a whole about e-commerce Brazil. It might need to include additional data from various platforms to identify the competitive dynamics or market share.\n\n\n## Recommendations\n- Furthermore, RFM analysis is used to statistically evaluate the profitability of individual segments over a long period. On top of the RFM analysis, a customer lifetime value can be used to measure the long-term profitability of different customer segments. Therefore, marketers can better understand and shape their customer segmentation strategies and prioritize marketing endeavors to capture their target market accordingly.\n\n  \n### References\n\n1.
